# HASTIKA @ ICON-2026 — Starting Kit

**Hate Speech and Target Category Identification in Kannada-English Code-Mixed Text**

This repository contains the **training-phase** data, submission format, a baseline, and
sample submissions for the HASTIKA shared task. Registration, submission, and the
leaderboards are on CodaBench:

➡️ **CodaBench:** https://www.codabench.org/competitions/17784/

## Overview

Social media in India is heavily **code-mixed** — native languages blended with English in a
single utterance. HASTIKA targets hate speech detection in low-resource **Kannada-English
(Kanglish)** text, using **8,058 manually annotated** YouTube comments.

The task has two independent sub-tasks (**separate leaderboards** — you may enter either or both):

- **Task A — Binary Hate Speech Detection:** classify a comment as `Hate` or `Non-Hate`.
- **Task B — Fine-Grained Hate Speech Classification:** classify a **hate** comment into one of
  six target categories: `Gender`, `Political`, `Religion`, `Geo-political`, `Violence`, `Others`.

## Data

This repo provides the **training-phase** files (released 20 Aug). Test inputs are released
on 20 Sep; test gold labels are never released — scoring happens on CodaBench.

| File | Rows | Columns | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| `data/binary_train.csv` | 6,446 | `id, Comment, Label` | Task A training data (with labels) |
| `data/binary_validation_inputs.csv` | 806 | `id, Comment` | Task A validation inputs (**no labels** — predict & submit) |
| `data/multiclass_train.csv` | 3,159 | `id, Comment, Hate Category` | Task B training data (with labels) |
| `data/multiclass_validation_inputs.csv` | 395 | `id, Comment` | Task B validation inputs (**no labels** — predict & submit) |

**Labels**
- Task A `Label`: `Hate` / `Non-Hate`
- Task B `Hate Category`: `Gender`, `Political`, `Religion`, `Geo-political`, `Violence`, `Others`

> Note: keep the `id` column from the provided file **unchanged** in your submission — it is how
> predictions are matched to the gold labels.

## Submission format

Submit a single **`predictions.csv`** (zipped) to the matching phase/task on CodaBench.

**Task A — `predictions.csv`**
```
id,label
7417,Non-Hate
958,Hate
```
Accepted label values: `Hate`, `Non-Hate`.

**Task B — `predictions.csv`**
```
id,label
958,Political
4204,Political
```
Accepted label values: `Gender`, `Political`, `Religion`, `Geo-political`, `Violence`, `Others`.

**Rules**
- One row per `id` from the input file.
- Header must be `id,label`.
- Zip **only** `predictions.csv` (no enclosing folder) before uploading. If your tool nests it in a
  folder, that is handled, but a flat zip is safest.
- UTF-8 encoding.

See `docs/starting_kit/` for ready-made sample submissions.

## Evaluation

- **Macro-averaged F1** — the **primary ranking metric** (weights every class equally, so rare
  categories such as *Geo-political* count as much as frequent ones).
- **Accuracy** — reported alongside.

Task A is scored over the two binary classes; Task B over the six categories.
